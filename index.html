        <h2 class="firstp" id="secondh2">About the COVID pendamic</h2>
        <p class="secondp">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
        Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
        <h4 class="ulc">HOW IT SPREADS</h4>
        <p class="secondp">The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
        You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>

        <h2 class="firstp">Preventions</h2>
            <p class="secondp">Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow advice provided by your local health authority.
                <h4 class="ulc" id="firsth4">To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</h4>
                <ul class="ulc">
                    <li>Clean your hands often.</li>
                    <li>Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
                    <li>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
                    <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
                    <li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
                </ul> 
                <p class="secondp">Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents spread of viruses and other infections.
                Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
